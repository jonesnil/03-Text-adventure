What is something you learned by reviewing your peer's project?

 I got an idea of how to incorporate an inventory system.

What is something you saw in your peer's project that you would like to apply to your own programming projects?

 I really like how he implemented an inventory system in a comedic fashion. 

What suggestions would you have for your peer to improve his/her code?

 There were one or two grammatical mistakes that could be fixed. Also, I played it a second time with the intention of just fixing the fountain and not going to jail, but that appeared to be the only ending.

What could have been clearer or better commented?

 I didn't notice anything. The game was really enjoyable, and I had a great time playing it.

Was there anything in the code that was confusing to you? If so, what?

 The inventory system.

Does the repository contain an appropriate LICENSE?

 Yes

What is something he/she could add to the README.md to make it more descriptive?

 Maybe he could describe why he thinks that main.py is a mess

Pay a compliment to your peer based on the quality of his/her code.

The dialogue was witty and enjoyable. The use of the items at the end was amazing and a great parady inventory systems. I really enjoyed this game.
