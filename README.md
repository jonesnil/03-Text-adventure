# 03-Text-adventure

Small text adventure game about a narrator stuck with a crazy protagonist in a closed museum. Built a crude inventory system, 
and a way to change what text appears based on where you came from when you move somewhere. Wasn't sure what to do for the 
ending but wanted to use the inventory system. The main file is kind of a mess, sorry, I made a lot of changes to it
and some weren't used much in the game but it's basically just the one provided. Wanted to make it allow bad verbs and keep the 
 game going, but ran out of time, might add later.
